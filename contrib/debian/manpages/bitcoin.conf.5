.TH ELUNIUM.CONF "5" "January 2011" "elunium.conf 3.19"
.SH NAME
elunium.conf \- elunium configuration file
.SH SYNOPSIS
All command-line options (except for '\-conf') may be specified in a configuration file, and all configuration file options may also be specified on the command line. Command-line options override values set in the configuration file.
.TP
The configuration file is a list of 'setting=value' pairs, one per line, with optional comments starting with the '#' character.
.TP
The configuration file is not automatically created; you can create it using your favorite plain-text editor. By default, eluniumd(1) will look for a file named elunium.conf(5) in the elunium data directory, but both the data directory and the configuration file path may be changed using the '\-datadir' and '\-conf' command-line arguments.
.SH LOCATION
elunium.conf should be located in $HOME/.elunium

.SH MISCELLANEOUS OPTIONS
.TP
\fBgen=\fR[\fI'0'\fR|\fI'1'\fR]
Enable or disable attempt to generate ELUNIUMs.
.TP
\fB4way=\fR[\fI'0'\fR|\fI'1'\fR]
Enable or disable use SSE instructions to try to generate ELUNIUMs faster.
.TP
\fBkeypool=\fR\fI'100'\fR

.TP
\fBpaytxfee=\fR\fI'0.00'\fR
